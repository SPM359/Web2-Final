        <h1>Park History</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Located along the Athabasca River (the primary highway of the day), this post was established and managed by two of Canada’s fur trading heavyweights: Hudson’s Bay Company and North West Company. The town and park would eventually get their name from one of the post’s managers and voyageur, Jasper Haws.<br>In 1907, the government protected the area as Jasper Forest Park, just as Canada’s second transcontinental rail line was set to pass through and foster the hamlet of Fitzhugh. The town grew, was renamed Jasper, and soon began welcoming tourists seeking adventure and beauty among the mountains.<br>From the valley’s first human residents to early mountaineering expeditions to modern reconnections with nature, Jasper has always welcomed those who wish to venture beyond.</p>

            <p>Before 1907, the boundaries of what is now Jasper National Park did not exist. Since time immemorial, a diversity of Indigenous peoples lived on this land, and utilized and cared for the natural resources. Some groups spent almost all year in the Rocky Mountains, while others came to or through the area on a seasonal basis to access resources and ceremonial sites, to meet with other groups, or to use the mountain passes that permitted travel across the mountains. <br>Indigenou s peoples protected the land and resources according to the learned principles of conservation and their worldviews that see humans as part of, and something that must remain in balance with, the land and ecosystems on which they relied. This intimate knowledge of the land is expressed through the concept of respect – respect for the land, respect for living things, respect for Elders and respect for traditional ways.</p>

            <h2>Indigenous Relations</h2>
            <p>Parks Canada is committed to building strong and mutually beneficial working relationships with Indigenous peoples. Jasper National Park’s Indigenous Relations Office works with diverse Indigenous communities and groups with historical connections to the park and is the corner stone of interaction between Indigenous partners and park management, operations and projects. Jasper National Park is working with Indigenous partners to strengthen connections with traditionally used lands and waters, respect Indigenous rights and expand and ensure the presentation and commemoration of Indigenous histories and cultures within the park.</p>
