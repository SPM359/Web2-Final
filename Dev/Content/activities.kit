                <h2>Climbing</h2>
                <p>The Mountain National Parks are a mountaineer’s smorgasbord with hundreds of peaks and countless routes ranging from straightforward glacier walks to never-repeated Grade VI alpine test pieces. New routes are put up nearly every season. These mountains are your oyster, but their challenges are not to be taken lightly. The rock in Selkirk Mountains of Glacier National Park is relatively solid and enjoyable to climb.</p>

                <h2>Skating</h2>
                <p>What could be more Canadian than pond skating? Both Pyramid and Mildred lakes are cleared off each winter and offer free-skating ovals along with rinks for a game of shinny hockey. Once in a while, temperatures drop before the snow falls, leaving many ponds and lakes covered in a thick layer of transparent ice. Skating in these conditions is as close as a person can get to flying.</p>

                <h2>Skiing</h2>
                <p>Jasper National Park offers a wide range of easy short ski touring, alpine ski touring and ski mountaineering day trips to long multi-day glacial traverses. These areas are often in wild and uncontrolled avalanche and glacier terrain. The snowpack can normally be depended upon to provide a solid enough base to carry off-piste and backcountry skiers by mid-February, but careful route-finding is imperative on mountain trails and routes.</p>

                <h2>Star Gazing</h2>
                <p>Jasper National Park is the second largest dark sky preserve in the world! Dark-Sky Preserves make a special commitment to protect and preserve the night sky and to reduce or eliminate light pollution in all its forms. During the month of October we show our appreciation and celebrate the night sky with dark sky month. If you can’t make it during that time, Parks Canada still has lots of dark sky programming throughout the month (and year) that showcases this natural treasure.</p>
