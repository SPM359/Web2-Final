        <div>//img</div>
        <p>Jasper National Park is an area of dramatic mountain peaks and expansive valleys. Many of the mountains rise to elevations above 3000 metres. Mt. Columbia, the highest peak in Alberta, is 3782 metres. The lowest point in the park, 985 metres above sea level, lies near the park's east gate.<br>The mountains in Jasper National Park form ranges running parallel to one another in a northwest to southeast alignment. The westernmost range in this series is the highest. It also forms the continental divide, separating streams that flow east and north to the Arctic Ocean or Hudson Bay from those which drain westward to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

        <p>The main ranges are the highest ranges (they include Mt. Robson and the group of mammoth peaks surrounding the Columbia Icefield). The main ranges form the continental divide, which splits North America into eastern and western slopes.<br>East of the main ranges are the front ranges of the Rockies. The sea allowed for the profusion of a great many plants and animals here, probably because of its shallowness. The organic material that resulted contributed lime mud, which thickened and hardened into massive amounts of limestone. The front ranges are pale grey (from the lime) and distinct from the reddish/brownish main ranges. Typical front-range peaks in Jasper are the Colin Range and Roche Miette. Farther east, out of the park, we get to the foothills, those gentle mounds that appear just before the flatness of the plains.</p>

                <h3>Athabasca Falls</h3>
                <p>The 23-metre Athabasca Falls is not very high by Canadian Rockies standards, but the size of the river makes it one of the most powerful falls to be found in the mountain national parks. Pouring over a layer of hard quartzite, the falls have cut into the softer limestone beneath, carving intricate features, including potholes and a short canyon.</p>

                <h3>Columbia Icefield</h3>
                <p>The Columbia Icefield is a surviving remnant of the thick ice mass that once mantled most of Western Canada's mountains. Lying on a wide, elevated plateau, it is the largest icefield in the Canadian Rockies. Nearly three-quarters of the park's highest peaks are located close to the icefield.</p>

                <h3>Icefields Parkway</h3>
                <p>Connecting two Canadian national parks and linking Lake Louise in the south with Jasper in the north, the Icefields Parkway is one of the top 10 scenic drives in the world. The 230-km journey through the heart of the Canadian Rocky Mountains offers the opportunity to travel through protected wildlife habitats and to witness nature at work. </p>

                <h3>Maligne Canyon</h3>
                <p>Waterfalls, fossils, potholes, underground stream outlets, the nests of ravens and rare black swifts, unexpectedly lush plant life and the startling effects of frost action - these are just some of the wonders of Maligne Canyon. Swirling, churning water has worn the canyon, only two metres across at some points, to a depth of more than 50 metres.</p>

                <h3>Maligne Lake</h3>
                <p>Maligne Lake is the largest natural lake in the Canadian Rockies. Ringed by snow-and-ice-capped mountains, the 22 km long lake stretches past serene Spirit Island right to the melt-water channels of Coronet Glacier. An open forest of lodgepole pine and spruce, home of moose and many other types of wildlife surround visitors at the north end of the lake.</p>

                <h3>Mount Edith Cavell</h3>
                <p>An impressive 3,300-metre peak, Mount Edith Cavell is named after a British nurse executed during World War I for her part in helping Allied prisoners escape occupied Brussels. A narrow 14 kilometre road brings visitors close to the mountain's north face, an area famous for the Cavell Meadows, alpine flowers and spectacular views of Angel Glacier.</p>

                <h3>Sunwapta Falls</h3>
                <p>A torrent of plunging water not far from the Icefields Parkway, Sunwapta Falls is just one of the many waterfalls in Jasper created by hanging valleys. At Sunwapta Falls, the smaller "hanging" Chaba Valley and larger Athabasca Valley join in a spectacular stepping waterfall that has carved a deep limestone gorge out of the rock some metres below the footbridge.</p>
