            <h1>Park History</h1>
            <article>
                <p>Located along the Athabasca River (the primary highway of the day), this post was established and managed by two of Canada’s fur trading heavyweights: Hudson’s Bay Company and North West Company. The town and park would eventually get their name from one of the post’s managers and voyageur, Jasper Haws.<br>In 1907, the government protected the area as Jasper Forest Park, just as Canada’s second transcontinental rail line was set to pass through and foster the hamlet of Fitzhugh. The town grew, was renamed Jasper, and soon began welcoming tourists seeking adventure and beauty among the mountains.<br>From the valley’s first human residents to early mountaineering expeditions to modern reconnections with nature, Jasper has always welcomed those who wish to venture beyond.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>Before 1907, the boundaries of what is now Jasper National Park did not exist. Since time immemorial, a diversity of Indigenous peoples lived on this land, and utilized and cared for the natural resources. Some groups spent almost all year in the Rocky Mountains, while others came to or through the area on a seasonal basis to access resources and ceremonial sites, to meet with other groups, or to use the mountain passes that permitted travel across the mountains. <br>Indigenou s peoples protected the land and resources according to the learned principles of conservation and their worldviews that see humans as part of, and something that must remain in balance with, the land and ecosystems on which they relied. This intimate knowledge of the land is expressed through the concept of respect – respect for the land, respect for living things, respect for Elders and respect for traditional ways.</p>

                <h2>Indigenous Relations</h2>
                <p>Parks Canada is committed to building strong and mutually beneficial working relationships with Indigenous peoples. Jasper National Park’s Indigenous Relations Office works with diverse Indigenous communities and groups with historical connections to the park and is the corner stone of interaction between Indigenous partners and park management, operations and projects. Jasper National Park is working with Indigenous partners to strengthen connections with traditionally used lands and waters, respect Indigenous rights and expand and ensure the presentation and commemoration of Indigenous histories and cultures within the park.</p>

            <h1>Natural Features</h1>
            <div>//img</div>
            <p>Jasper National Park is an area of dramatic mountain peaks and expansive valleys. Many of the mountains rise to elevations above 3000 metres. Mt. Columbia, the highest peak in Alberta, is 3782 metres. The lowest point in the park, 985 metres above sea level, lies near the park's east gate.<br>The mountains in Jasper National Park form ranges running parallel to one another in a northwest to southeast alignment. The westernmost range in this series is the highest. It also forms the continental divide, separating streams that flow east and north to the Arctic Ocean or Hudson Bay from those which drain westward to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

            </aside>
            <div>//img</div>
            <p>The main ranges are the highest ranges (they include Mt. Robson and the group of mammoth peaks surrounding the Columbia Icefield). The main ranges form the continental divide, which splits North America into eastern and western slopes.<br>East of the main ranges are the front ranges of the Rockies. The sea allowed for the profusion of a great many plants and animals here, probably because of its shallowness. The organic material that resulted contributed lime mud, which thickened and hardened into massive amounts of limestone. The front ranges are pale grey (from the lime) and distinct from the reddish/brownish main ranges. Typical front-range peaks in Jasper are the Colin Range and Roche Miette. Farther east, out of the park, we get to the foothills, those gentle mounds that appear just before the flatness of the plains.</p>

                    <h3>Athabasca Falls</h3>
                    <p>The 23-metre Athabasca Falls is not very high by Canadian Rockies standards, but the size of the river makes it one of the most powerful falls to be found in the mountain national parks. Pouring over a layer of hard quartzite, the falls have cut into the softer limestone beneath, carving intricate features, including potholes and a short canyon.</p>

                    <h3>Columbia Icefield</h3>
                    <p>The Columbia Icefield is a surviving remnant of the thick ice mass that once mantled most of Western Canada's mountains. Lying on a wide, elevated plateau, it is the largest icefield in the Canadian Rockies. Nearly three-quarters of the park's highest peaks are located close to the icefield.</p>

                    <p>Connecting two Canadian national parks and linking Lake Louise in the south with Jasper in the north, the Icefields Parkway is one of the top 10 scenic drives in the world. The 230-km journey through the heart of the Canadian Rocky Mountains offers the opportunity to travel through protected wildlife habitats and to witness nature at work. </p>

                    <p>Waterfalls, fossils, potholes, underground stream outlets, the nests of ravens and rare black swifts, unexpectedly lush plant life and the startling effects of frost action - these are just some of the wonders of Maligne Canyon. Swirling, churning water has worn the canyon, only two metres across at some points, to a depth of more than 50 metres.</p>

                    <p>Maligne Lake is the largest natural lake in the Canadian Rockies. Ringed by snow-and-ice-capped mountains, the 22 km long lake stretches past serene Spirit Island right to the melt-water channels of Coronet Glacier. An open forest of lodgepole pine and spruce, home of moose and many other types of wildlife surround visitors at the north end of the lake.</p>

                    <p>An impressive 3,300-metre peak, Mount Edith Cavell is named after a British nurse executed during World War I for her part in helping Allied prisoners escape occupied Brussels. A narrow 14 kilometre road brings visitors close to the mountain's north face, an area famous for the Cavell Meadows, alpine flowers and spectacular views of Angel Glacier.</p>

                    <p>A torrent of plunging water not far from the Icefields Parkway, Sunwapta Falls is just one of the many waterfalls in Jasper created by hanging valleys. At Sunwapta Falls, the smaller "hanging" Chaba Valley and larger Athabasca Valley join in a spectacular stepping waterfall that has carved a deep limestone gorge out of the rock some metres below the footbridge.</p>

            <h1>Wildlife</h1>
            <div>//img</div>
            <p>Climate, geology, soil, plants, animals – and humans all interact in one large complex web of life. In Jasper this web is especially fragile. Here existence depends on the intricate relationships between flora and fauna, weather and landscape. These relationships, called ecosystems, can be upset by the smallest of changes, affecting even the largest of animals, including Jasper's monarch, the grizzly.<br>Jasper National Park is located on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains of west-central Alberta, east of the continental divide. This location strongly influences its climate, geology, plants and animals, and also has affected its human history. The mountain landscape has been formed by a variety of geological events over millions of years. This has resulted in a rugged topography with a large range in altitude from about 985 metres in the Athabasca Valley to nearly 3800 metres at the top of Mt. Columbia.</p>
            <div>//img</div>
            <p>These altitudinal differences influence the climate, with higher altitudes being colder and generally wetter, while lower altitudes are warmer and drier. As well, Jasper National Park's location east of the continental divide also affects the climate. The eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains are drier than the western slopes in adjacent British Columbia due to a rain shadow effect. This occurs when storms moving eastward from the Pacific Ocean drop much of their moisture on the western slopes as the clouds are forced higher by the mountains. The eastern slopes are also more frequently subjected to Arctic air plunging southward, especially in the winter. As a result of these two influences, Jasper is generally colder and drier than areas to the west.</p>

                        <div>//img</div>
                        <h3>Montane</h3>
                        <p>The montane life zone is warm, dry and found only on the very bottoms of the Athabasca and Miette Valleys in Jasper. Here Douglas Fir stands hug south facing slopes, the furthest north in Alberta this species grows. Warm chinook winds sweep through the valleys in winter, melting snow and making forage in the extensive grasslands easy for elk, moose, deer and sheep. Bears, waking in spring, roam in and out of the montane, feasting on the red-and-orange buffalo berries for weeks at a time in the fall. Wolves and cougars move through the valleys in search of food while bald eagles and osprey nest near the rivers, close to the pike and mountain white fish they feed their young.</p>

                        <div>//img</div>
                        <h3>Subalpine</h3>
                        <p>The subalpine is a great sweeping forest that curls around mountainsides, fringed at treeline by grotesquely stunted trees called krumholtz. Dark and wet, the mostly spruce mixed with pine and sub-alpine fir forest that stretches up from the montane is habitat for a limited number of animals. Pine martins, large cat-like weasels, and their larger cousin the wolverine roam the subalpine. In the winter, lynx, moose and caribou frequent the life zone, using their large paws and hooves to maneuver through the deep snow. Clark's nutcrackers, the boreal chickadee, winter wren, golden-crowned kinglet, varied thrush, yellow-rumped warbler and the dark-eyed junco also call the subalpine home.</p>

                        <div>//img</div>
                        <h3>Alpine</h3>
                        <p>Characterized by howling winds that scour the rocky earth, the alpine is the most intricate of Jasper's three life zones. Flowers that survive in the alpine do so using subtle techniques. Large, cup-shaped pedals act like mirrors, focusing sunlight on the centre of the flower, where pollen is produced. This creates a warm, mini-environment, attracting small insects that spread the pollen to other plants, procreating the species. Reddish pigments in flowers also help convert light into heat and act as a kind of antifreeze for the plants.</p>

                <h3>Fauna</h3>
                <p>The United Nations created the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site partly because of the incredible diversity of animals found here. Jasper National Park is home to 53 species of mammals, mammals that rely on a variety of habitats, some of which we share with them. When visiting the park, please remember that you are visiting the animals' habitat. Their continued health and survival relies on us making as little impact on their home as possible.</p>

                <p>“Jasper's Monarch, The Grizzly Bear”</p>
                <p>National Parks help protect uniquely Canadian landscapes along with the ecosystems that wildlife depend upon for their survival. When our actions reduce an animal’s wildness, the natural character of our national parks diminishes. Whether you plan to drive the roads, hike or bike the trails, or relax in town, take time to understand the important precautions wild areas demand. Your responsible behaviour affects the survival of wildlife and helps ensure your safety.  The chance of seeing wildlife is one of the most exciting things about visiting the mountain national parks. It is important to treat wild animals with respect. Approaching too closely threatens their survival. Once wildlife become accustomed to being around people, they are in danger of losing the very thing that makes them special – their wildness. Read the brochure Keep the Wild in Wildlife to learn more.</p>

                    <h2>Animal Safety</h2>
                    <p>Do not approach wildlife - stay 30m (3 bus lengths) away from elk and 100m (10 bus lengths) away from bears
                        Do not feed wildlife, this is unlawful in a national park and is addictive
                        Remain in your vehicle when viewing wildlife from the road (use a telephoto lens to get that 'perfect' picture) and quickly continue on your way
                        Keep your campsite clean by keeping all attractants in your vehicle - coolers are not bear proof and even dishwater and dog food will attract an animal
                        Stay on designated trails - unofficial trails are often used by wildlife</p>

                    <h2>Skating</h2>
                    <p>What could be more Canadian than pond skating? Both Pyramid and Mildred lakes are cleared off each winter and offer free-skating ovals along with rinks for a game of shinny hockey. Once in a while, temperatures drop before the snow falls, leaving many ponds and lakes covered in a thick layer of transparent ice. Skating in these conditions is as close as a person can get to flying.</p>

                    <p>Jasper National Park offers a wide range of easy short ski touring, alpine ski touring and ski mountaineering day trips to long multi-day glacial traverses. These areas are often in wild and uncontrolled avalanche and glacier terrain. The snowpack can normally be depended upon to provide a solid enough base to carry off-piste and backcountry skiers by mid-February, but careful route-finding is imperative on mountain trails and routes.</p>
